3. You can also ask your team member whether they have the credential info, usally stored as an `.aws` folder, so you do not need to click the Create Access Key, keep the access_key and key_id secretly.  \
The .aws folder contains two files: credentials and config(They look like following figs). \
If you don't have the files you can create by your own.(1. by using touch command mannually 2. See section Amplify Setup->Step 2)

### Step 2. Setup Local Config

**Amplify will scan your user directory and check `.aws` folder for authentication.**

1. If you have the `.aws` folder with `credentials` and `config` files, put whole folder into user directory (`echo $HOME` will display actual path)
2. If you and your teamates does not have the .aws folder in your user directory, then run `aws configure`
it will require your `key_id` and `access_key` and make an `.aws` folder with credential info stored in your user directory.

	* **? Enter a name  for the environment `dev`  
	* **? Please choose a authentication method: `AWS Profile`  
	* **? Do you want to update code for your updated GraphQL API? `No`  
	!!!!!!!!!THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!  
	!!!!!!!!DO NOT UPDATE GraphQL API!!!!!!  
        Reasons are as following: The new version of amplify provide several new functionalities, but it require the conflict resolver function, The schema was designed under old version of Amplify, and turn on this functionality will cause the app not be able to do the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries.
	
3. If you finish the amplify init, please doubble confirm the conflict resoultion function is closed by: 
	type `amplify update api` \
	* **? Select from one of the below mentioned services:`GraphQL`
	
        * **Your terminal should prompt the current setting of api, the Conflict detection should be disabled

3. Refresh the page, your user status should be confirmed now
4. Do not forget to create a Interviewee account, it is required for interviewee to successfully
5. Please enter a random email or phone and mark it as verified in cognito

### Step 5 - Deployment
1. After the amplify init is finished, type  `npm run build` 
2. then type  `npm run deploy`
NOTICE: if the `npm run deploy` has fatal: remote hang up error , try it in other network environment (i.g personal hotspot)
